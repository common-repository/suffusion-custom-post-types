A plugin that helps you move away from the Suffusion WP theme by letting you carry the custom post types and taxonomies you defined with the theme.

== Description ==

This plugin is an add-on to the Suffusion WordPress Theme. When Custom Post Types were introduced in WP there were no plugins to help users define the post types via a UI.
So the theme offered a UI as a part of its back-end to help users define post types and taxonomies. With the changing plugin landscape there are several plugins that offer
the capability to define custom post types, so this code is not included in the theme with effect from version 4.0.0 of Suffusion.

However you might already be using this functionality within Suffusion, hence this plugin is meant to offer you the ability to edit what you have defined
and add more to the list. Also, in case you decide to move away from Suffusion, this plugin will help you carry your custom post types to your new theme.

More features will be added in the future.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it,
or by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped
contents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

None.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any enhancements planned? =

Yes, there will be a handful of them, like meta-boxes for custom post types etc.

= Are there any known issues? =

The plugin requires a bit of JavaScript in the back-end. For this it uses JQuery. If there is another plugin that includes
JQuery improperly, then there might be issues getting the plugin to work. This isn't a problem with the Commerce Pack, rather it
is a problem with the plugin that is improperly including JQuery.
